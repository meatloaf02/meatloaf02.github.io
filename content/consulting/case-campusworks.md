## CampusWorks Engagement

### Overview
CHESS—a consortium of New Mexico colleges—launched a multi-institution transformation to modernize the student experience and streamline financial aid and student finance operations through Workday Student. As a consultant 
specializing in higher-education systems, I partnered with CampusWorks to provide strategic business analysis, integration design, and deep Workday product expertise rooted in my background as the former Product Manager for 
Workday Student Financial Aid & Student Finance. My role helped CHESS interpret complex product logic, align cross-institution processes, and make confident configuration decisions that support both regulatory compliance and the consortium’s long-term shared-services vision.

### Challenge
CHESS’s vision requires high-impact alignment across colleges on sensitive areas such as:
- Financial Aid packaging, SAP, R2T4, and verification
- Cross-institution enrollment, billing, and revenue distribution
- Multi-institution ISIR and document management workflows
- Designing for a future shared-services operating model
These decisions are both policy-intensive and product-dependent. Institutions needed expert guidance to ensure their Workday configuration supported compliance, automation, and a unified student experience.

### Approach
**Product-Informed Strategy**
I translated Workday’s underlying Financial Aid and Student Finance design principles into actionable choices—providing institutions with clarity on why the system behaves as it does and how to configure it for a consortium environment.

**Cross-Institution Process Alignment**
Guided collaborative sessions to harmonize awarding rules, tuition/fee structures, home/host enrollment logic, and communication models across all CHESS colleges.

**Integration & Compliance Architecture**
Designed approaches for ISIR/NSLDS processing, bookstore eligibility, third-party sponsorships, payment plans, and audit-critical workflows such as R2T4 and SAP.
**
Shared-Services Readiness**
Mapped future-state responsibilities between institutional FA offices and CHESS’s centralized FA service center, including partitioned security, ownership boundaries, and end-to-end process flows.

### Results
- Accelerated clarity and decision-making through expert grounding in Workday’s regulatory and configuration model
- Consortium-wide alignment on complex FA and SF processes that historically vary across institutions
- Reduced compliance risk, especially for SAP, R2T4, and over-award scenarios
- Future-proofed design enabling CHESS’s centralized FA service center and scalable operating model
- Enhanced student experience with unified billing, single-submission documentation, mobile-first workflows, and proactive FA notifications
